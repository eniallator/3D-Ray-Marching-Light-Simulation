## To Run Success Criteria

`main.lua` is the entry point for this game engine, so you need to:

Copy the desired success criteria scene into the base level folder and name it `main.lua` (you will have to rename the current `main.lua`).

## To Test

You must have luafilesystem installed, as the test runner uses this.
Once you have this dependency, run the following command:

```properties
lua test.lua
```
